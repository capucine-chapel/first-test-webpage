abstract: This study aims to identify the determinants of satisfaction with green spaces among residents of 72 European cities through a life satisfaction approach using Eurobarometer survey data in 2019 and the green land cover of the Urban Atlas. Using a linear probability model, we regress the satisfaction of city dwellers with regard to green spaces on indicators of availability and accessibility of green spaces at the city level, both in stock and in variation. We show that, in general, satisfaction with green spaces is determined by both their availability and, even more importantly, their accessibility. Furthermore, satisfaction is not driven by the current level of these two indicators, but rather by their improvement since 2012. We also identify heterogeneities in the determinants of satisfaction according to the socio-demographic characteristics of the individuals. In particular, individuals with financial difficulties or children value only the variation of the dimension of accessibility of green spaces whilst individuals who have not always lived in their current city of residence are also impacted by the current stock of accessibility. These results provide an indication of the dimensions to be prioritised for current and future public policies in favour of green spaces.

# summary: Does civil resistance work for the most marginalized? In this paper we show that transitions initiated through civil resistance lead to significant gains in political inclusion along lines of race, class, and gender.

## **Abstract**
# Nonviolent civil resistance campaigns have a well-documented positive effect on democracy. Yet this relationship has been primarily based on measures of liberal or electoral democracy. The impact of civil resistance on egalitarian democracy, particularly the inclusion in state power and resources of historically excluded groups, has been less examined. This paper tests the hypotheses that initiating a political transition through civil resistance will advance gender, class, and ethnic inclusion relative to other transition modes. Using cross-national data on egalitarianism and exclusion from the Varieties of Democracy project, we find that civil resistance transitions (CRTs) produce gains in inclusion along all three of these dimensions greater than those observed in non-civil resistance transitions. Furthermore, we find that participation by marginalized groups in the civil resistance campaign leads to further advances in inclusion. Our findings indicate that civil resistance may be a powerful force for promoting inclusion of the historically marginalized.
