I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Economics at [ERUDITE](https://erudite.univ-paris-est.fr/) since October 2023.

I am on the 2024 job market.

My research focuses on the analysis of sustainable development trajectories, with the aim of understanding the mechanisms, challenges and opportunities for steering societies towards a more sustainable future. My research falls within the fields of environmental, development and urban economics.

I have a strong interest in applied microeconometrics, spatial analysis and data processing.
